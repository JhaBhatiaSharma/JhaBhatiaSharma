\section{Overview and Implementation Plan}
\label{sec:overview_implementation}

This chapter describes the InternHub – Students \& Companies (S\&C) platform's integration strategy, test plan, and implementation procedure. A systematic and effective development process will be ensured by using the \textbf{Bottom-Up approach}.

The implementation will start with basic, independent modules that do not need additional modules to work. Drivers for testing each module separately will be created. Modules will gradually be added to the system, taking the place of their associated drivers as they are put into place and tested. For further testing, each integrated module will need its own driver.

Before a system is fully integrated, smaller functional subsystems can be created using the Bottom-Up approach. With this incremental approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing is performed on smaller parts of the system initially and continues for each module as it becomes ready, making debugging and error tracking easier.
    \item Parallel development is facilitated, allowing separate teams to work on various elements at the same time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Strategy}
\label{subsec:implementation_strategy}

\subsection{Overview and Integration Plan}
\label{subsubsec:integration_plan}

A systematic \textbf{bottom-up method} is used to integrate the system's components. The emphasis will be on developing solid foundational modules that can be gradually combined, starting with the essential elements. Before each module is integrated into the larger system, it will be tested using the relevant drivers. This approach enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel programming.
    \item Effective debugging.
    \item Incremental functional validation.
\end{itemize}

The following crucial areas will be included in the integration process:

\paragraph{Core Model Integration}

    \end{center}
\end{figure}
This integration also includes the Communication Manager to provide efficient communication for administrative duties. Functionalities like managing complaints, keeping an eye on platform activity, and producing reports are tested using the Admin Driver. This guarantees the stability and effectiveness of the platform's administrative functions.


\paragraph{Final System Integration}
All of the primary managers—Authentication Manager, Profile Manager, Internship Manager, Interview Manager, Communication Manager, and Admin Manager—must be connected to the \textbf{Dashboard Manager} as part of the last integration. This integration ensures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seamless coordination of data and processes across the platform.
    \item A unified user experience.
\end{itemize}
