\section{Overview and Implementation Plan}
\label{sec:overview_implementation}

This chapter describes the InternHub â€“ Students \& Companies (S\&C) platform's integration strategy, test plan, and implementation procedure. A systematic and effective development process will be ensured by using the \textbf{Bottom-Up approach}.

The implementation will start with basic, independent modules that do not need additional modules to work. Drivers for testing each module separately will be created. Modules will gradually be added to the system, taking the place of their associated drivers as they are implemented and tested. For further testing, each integrated module will need its own driver.

Before a system is fully integrated, smaller functional subsystems can be created using the Bottom-Up approach. With this incremental approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing is performed on smaller parts of the system initially and continues for each module as it becomes ready, making debugging and error tracking easier.
    \item Parallel development is facilitated, allowing separate teams to work on various elements simultaneously.
\end{itemize}
