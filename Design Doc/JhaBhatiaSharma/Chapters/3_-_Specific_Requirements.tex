This section outlines the \textbf{InternHub – Students \& Companies (S\&C)} platform's user interface, including a summary of the main pages that make up the system. Since changes to the design may be made throughout the testing phase, the design mockups displayed here focus more on the interface's usability and interaction dynamics than on its final visual aesthetics. Equivalent pages will be made for mobile devices, even if the desktop browser version is the main focus due to its suitability for thorough profile management and internship-related procedures. By adapting and scaling the interface to fit smaller screens, this guarantees a seamless user experience.

The design prototypes shown here serve as a fundamental depiction of the platform's user interface, as specified in the \textbf{RASD}. As the system develops, these designs are subject to optimization and improvement, taking into account input from user interactions and testing.
